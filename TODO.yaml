- FIX:
    - multiline macros with weird operations
    - Repair the focused and analyze modules

- FEAT:
    - support parametrized constructs
    - Combine many different sv files
    - Start doing coverage-based fuzzing
    - always_* modules

- CHORE:
    - make unit tests for the modules
    - Use the example_usage to effectively test many modules
    - Add a real CI to check that builds are clean
    - Make the program send an exit code non null when simulator errors
    - Add precommit hooks
